# Geospatial Data Visualization using kepler.gl

Geospatial data is goldmine right now and kepler.gl is a wonderful Python library for this. It is built on top of deck.gl â€“ another framework for visual exploratory data analysis of large datasets by Uber. The most amazing thing about kepler.gl is that it can also be used inside our Jupyter notebook, which makes it a handy tool for everyone in the data science community. Here I have taken elevation contours for San Francisco mainland and Treasure Island/Yerba Island. Based on San Francisco Elevation Datum. Data source: [DataSF](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nq/data).You can also have a look at some sample datasets given by Uber [here](https://github.com/uber-web/kepler.gl-data).

 ### Dependencies:
 1. kepler-gl - *pip install keplergl*
 2. geopandas - *pip install geopandas*
 
 ### Usage:
 A very short overview of the kepler.gl package has been demonstrated in the given Jupyter notebook. Just have a look and deep dive at the [documentation](https://docs.kepler.gl/docs/api-reference) to explore more :smile:
 
 The visualizations look super cool !!
